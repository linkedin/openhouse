OpenHouse is an open source control plane designed for efficient management of tables within open data lakehouse
deployments. The control plane comprises a **declarative catalog** and a suite of **data services**. Users can
seamlessly define Tables, their schemas, and associated metadata declaratively within the catalog.
OpenHouse reconciles the observed state of Tables with the desired state by orchestrating various
data services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For building and running locally in [Docker Compose](SETUP.md), you would need the following:

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
  - OpenHouse is currently built with Java 17.
  - Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the location of your JDK17.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

For deploying OpenHouse to [Kubernetes](DEPLOY.md), you would need the following:
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)

### Building OpenHouse

To build OpenHouse, you can use the following command:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Running OpenHouse with Docker Compose

To run OpenHouse, we recommend the [SETUP](SETUP.md) guide. You would bring up all the OpenHouse services, MySQL,
Prometheus, Apache Spark and HDFS.

### Deploying OpenHouse to Kubernetes

To deploy OpenHouse to Kubernetes, you can use the [DEPLOY](DEPLOY.md) guide. You would build the container images for
all the OpenHouse services, and deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
